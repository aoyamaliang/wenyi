                            The Pioneer Machinery is a professional manufacturing company for electric cable machinery based in Taipei. In this project, I worked with the Research and Development Team at Pioneer Machinery where I was responsible for designing engaging answers for
                            the Smart Factory program. The time span of the project was 6 months, I mainly focused on designing the interactive interface for the smart factory. Besides, I also designed the mechanical structure that attached smart glasses
                            to a helmet. The outcomes of our design included an interactive map and the portable HMI that could overview the whole process line and a real-time surveillance system for advisors.

                            various perspectives. We conducted the focus group to find their perspectives and needs. We also had a meeting with CIO and software engineers to understand what techniques could support our design.

                            Basically, in the smart factory project, we mainly have four systems. One is an interactive map that could overview the process line data in the control room. One is a portable HMI that provides advisors producing process information anytime and anywhere.
                            One is an HMI stands in the factory which allows workers to control the machine. The other is an augmented reality glasses that workers can scan the QR code attached to the machine to check the realtime data so that they donâ€™t
                            need to walk up and down in the factory. My role is focused on designing the interface of portable HMI and interactive map and the mechanical of glasses.

                            in each page. Here is the information architecture that I created for the portable HMI:

                                    in the navigation bar.

                                    In the cable production process, temperature, machine speed, and other factors will affect the yield. Therefore, tracking the current status and target status is important. We present both the default value and the current value in the interface. In the
                                    production speed, we use visualization instead of the text reading to display the speed deviation.

                                    the compare of default temperature and current value. Besides, the color also shows the situation of temperature deviation. Green is that the temperature is within the safe zone. Red is that the temperature is higher

                                    page and with a click, the history list will change to the next ten rows to reduce the process of repetitive clicking.

                            Due to the fact that I joined the interactive map development team when my intern was drawing to the close, I only designed the initial overlook of the user interface. In this term, I focus on designing the interface which
                            meets the technology that engineers could support instead of designing intuitive and user-centered interface.
